# PROGRESS.md

## Iteration #1

### Detected Stack
- Node.js/TypeScript (pnpm, Next.js/React, Express/Orchestrator)
- Python (scripts, some backend services)
- Test runners: Vitest, Playwright, Pytest
- Existing: partial test plan, some test scaffolding, missing/partial CI, missing coverage, missing a11y/perf/security gates

### TODO (Ranked)
1. Scaffold missing config: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, Playwright, Vitest, coverage, a11y, perf, security, .env.example
2. Add/refresh scripts: lint, format, typecheck, test, e2e, perf, security, fix, ci
3. Add/refresh CI: .github/workflows/ci.yml (matrix, cache, all gates)
4. Add/refresh docs: coverage.md, ci.md, perf.md, RUNBOOK.md
5. Add/refresh test/mocks/utils/fixtures for all test types
6. Validate: run all scripts, parse failures, fix, iterate

### Next Steps
- CHANGE: Begin with config and scripts scaffolding for all gates.
- VALIDATE: Run lint, typecheck, test, e2e, perf, security.
- REPORT: Update PROGRESS.md, commit, repeat.
